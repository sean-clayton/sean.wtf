WTFPL, but better ðŸ˜Š

It removes the restriction of license changing from WTFPL-2.0.
It also adds the liability clause of WTFPL-3.0,
but removes the mentions of software to keep this license applicable to artwork, etc.
Most importantly, it keeps this license further out of the hands of suits by adding a 69 420 reference in the version &#128513;.

The WTFPL-69.420 is licensed under the WTFPL-69.420.
