### Google Cloud went down today

Google Cloud[^1] [went down today](https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/compute/19003).
Funnily enough, it affected this tiny little site while developing it.
Fortunately it wasn't too long before it was back and running like new.
Maybe Google should invest in some fault-tolerant systems ðŸ˜œ

### Stevie Nicks had a birthday

In honor of Stevie Nicks' birthday (May 26), I present you with an amazing live rendition of an amazing song by Fleetwood Mac:

### There is a Spotify playlist of local Louisvillian musicians

[A fellow Louisville-based Redditor shared a playlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisville/comments/bv84ss/louisville_now_a_spotify_playlist_featuring) of some active Louisville musicians. Give it a listen-over.

### Game of Thrones ended

I've been watching the show as-it-aired since the second season, which was a little over 7 years ago.
I'm not going to get into my opinion of the show (for now), but I will leave you all with a few shows to watch that I believe are on-par or better than GoT in terms of entertainment value:

1. Avatar: The Last Airbender
1. The Expanse
1. True Detective
1. Veep
1. Bob's Burgers

Chernobyl is also a very interesting show, but it's more of a fake documentary kinda deal.

### Joe Armstrong[^2] has passed

Goodbye, Joe ðŸ˜¢
