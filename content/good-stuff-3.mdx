Been a while since I posted, and I figured a [Good Stuff](/series/good-stuff) post should fit the bill.

### F&#35;

I've recently fallen in love with F#[^1]!
It has a ton of things I really like in other functional languages like Elixir[^2], ReasonML[^3]/OCaml[^3], and Haskell[^5], but it has an awesome interop story for .NET stuff.
For example, the Godot game engine[^6] has mono support, but it's an imperative/object-oriented API.
Luckily, though, you can write ~95% of your code in F#.
With just a few clicks in your IDE you can get Godot's .NET API code completion while writing F# code and Godot can consume the things you made in F# to run in the engine.
Awesome stuff!

### Star Wars Tabletop RPG

I've recently started playing in a Star Wars TTRPG campaign!
It's a once-a-month ordeal and I've only played once so far, but getting to be a PC this time around has been a blast!
The mechanics of the system are also pretty neat compared to D&D 5e.
The dice system, while a bit cumbersome, allows a lot more storytelling than just rolling a d20.
Character backstory and experience spending is also much better, in my opinion, than 5e.
I highly recommend picking up one of the core rulebooks (Edge of the Empire, Force and Destiny, and Age of Rebellion) and trying it out!

### Guildship

For maybe three or so years now I've been toying around with an idea.
Essentially, it's like Discord, but a more async version that you would use _alongside_ Discord for your gaming community.
You get things like a forum, a calendar, a wiki, a blog, and a bunch of integrations to other services like Discord, Twitch, Mixer, etc.
Think of it like Facebook Groups, but gaming focused.
I recently have taken to just going through and start building it, so I'm pretty excited to see if I can actually launch this thing!
