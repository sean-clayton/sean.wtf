### Creating a Firebase Application

Firebase is a Google product, so in order to make a Firebase project you'll need a Google account.
Once you have one of those, head to https://console.firebase.google.com.
You should see a page that looks like the following screenshot.
Go ahead and add a project, give it a name, and don't worry about any other settings.

Once you finish up adding a project, you should see a nice success popup saying "Your new project is ready."
At that point, click the "Continue" button.

### Creating a Firebase Database

On the left-hand panel you should see a "Database" linkâ€”go there.
Once there you'll see a nice little page that has a bit of information on Firebase databases, but there should also be a button that says "Create database," which you'll want to click.
_*PLEASE NOTE*_: Make sure you start your database in "test mode" (unless you've worked Firebase before and know about permissions).
This allows anyone to start creating and reading data from this project's database.
Once you do that, click the "Enable" button.

### Hitting the API

That's all it takes to create your database, but now you'll want to hit it from your application.
I'm going to assume you're using the browser and have access to the `fetch` browser function.

You can create collections in Firebase by just creating an item _inside_ of the collection, like so:

```tsx
const res = await fetch(
  "https://my-awesome-project-2e475.firebaseio/my-cool-collection.json",
  {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      foo: "bar",
      fizz: "buzz",
    }),
  }
).then((r) => r.json());

console.log(res);
// { name: "-LQKG2GXHBzTgbzzUEC2" }
```

And then you can get all the items in your collection!

```tsx
const res = await fetch(
  "https://my-awesome-project-2e475.firebaseio/my-cool-collection.json"
).then((r) => r.json());

console.log(res);
/*
{
  "-LQKG2GXHBzTgbzzUEC2": {
    "fizz": "buzz",
    "foo": "bar"
  }
}
*/
```

You'll notice that we get an object instead of an array back from the API.
There's some benefits to this, namely we can just grab an item from the collection if we only have it's ID, like such:

```tsx
const id = "-LQKG2GXHBzTgbzzUEC2";
const item = res[id];

console.log(item);
// { fizz: "buzz", foo: "bar" }
```

If we want to conver that object into an array, we can use an object method called `Object.entries`.
I won't go over exactly what that does, but it essentially creates an array of arrays, so we can map over that array.
Here is how we can use this:

```tsx
const collectionArr = Object.entries(res).map(([id, attrs]) => ({
  id,
  ...attrs,
}));

console.log(collectionArr);
// [{ id: -LQKG2GXHBzTgbzzUEC2, fizz: "buzz", foo: "bar" }]
```

### Where to go From Here

So we've explained how to `GET` and `POST` to a Firebase API.
Firebase has a set of documentation on it's REST API, which you can find here:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/database/

From there you can see how to update items and delete them, or even [filter items] and [order items] in a collection!
Hopefully this gives you a good starting point on working with the Firebase REST API.

[order items]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/rest/retrieve-data#section-rest-ordered-data
