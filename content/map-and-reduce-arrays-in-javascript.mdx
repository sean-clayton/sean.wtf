[`Array.prototype.map`][0] and [`Array.prototype.reduce`][1] are some of the most _powerful_ array methods in JavaScript. Both serve similar purposes: Create a _new_ value from an array of values. But, what makes them awesome are also what make them different from each other.

### Map

The `map` method is purpose-built for creating a **new array** from an array. For example:

```tsx
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const arr2 = arr1.map((x) => x * 2);

console.log(arr2); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

This is fine and dandy, but in the real world we’re probably working with arrays of objects. Let’s say we have an array of friend objects that each have a name (string) and age (number). We want to just get an array of ages back. Map to the rescue!

```tsx
const friends = [
  { name: "Sean", age: 23 },
  { name: "Bob the Builder", age: 23 },
];

const ages = friends.map((friend) => friend.age); // [23, 23]
```

We can even use it with [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react)!

```tsx {3-7,9}
const FriendList = () => (
  <ul>
    {friends.map((friend, i) => (
      <li key={i}>
        {friend.name}, {friend.age}
      </li>
    ))}{" "}
    {/* Equivalent to... */}
    {[<li key={0}>Sean, 23</li>, <li key={1}>Bob the Builder, 23</li>]}
  </ul>
);
```

Map is a really neat way with taking an array of items and returning a new array of items. If you want to take an array of items and return _any_ kind of value (array, number, object, etc), you'll want to use another array method...

### Reduce

The `reduce` array method is for creating a **new thing** from an array. If you have an array of objects and it should return a single number, `Array.prototype.reduce` is a tool for the job. Let’s use the `ages` array we mentioned in the Map example above:

```tsx
const sumAges = ages.reduce(
  (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue,
  0
); // 46
```

Let’s break this down.

The `reduce` method takes _two_ arguments: A callback function to perform actions on the array and return a value, and an initial value (very important). Here’s the previous code refactored to be more obvious what piece is what:

```tsx
const callback = (accumulator, currentValue, _indexOfCurrent, _array) =>
  accumulator + currentValue;
const initialValue = 0;
const sumAges = ages.reduce(callback, initialValue);
```

You can see the callback function being passed a few values. It is important to understand that the `reduce` method is meant to “squish” all the values in an array into a single value. Yes, you can mimic the exact functionality of `map` with `reduce`, but that is sort of pointless, no? Why use reduce at all? Reduce _accumulates_ a single value by iterating over an array, performing some sort of computation, and returning a new value to accumulate onto. Rinse, repeat.

- `accumulator`: This is an important piece of the `reduce` puzzle. This represents a possible final value that you want returned from the `reduce` method. In the `sumAges` function above, we want a number returned. The accumulator will thus be a number. It could be 0, -100, or 1, but a number nonetheless.
- `currentValue`: While iterating over the array, you have access to a single value from the array (the value in which is currently in the iteration). You would most likely use this current value to create a new accumulated value.
- `currentIndex`: This is a non-negative number that represents the index of `currentValue` in the array you’re working with.
- `array`: This is the array you are working with. I’ve hardly used it before, but I it can be handy for writing pure functions. I’m _guessing_ this is the array you are working with as it was in memory when you first called `reduce` on it. I haven’t tested that theory, though.

I can hear you asking now: “Well Sean, what is the first value for `accumulator`?” I’m glad you asked, observant person. Before we mentioned the `initialValue` argument, and that does _exactly_ this. Let’s look again at the `sumAges` code from above:

```tsx
const callback = (accumulator, currentValue, _indexOfCurrent, _array) =>
  accumulator + currentValue;
const initialValue = 0;
const sumAges = ages.reduce(callback, initialValue);
```

You notice that we made initial value `0`. If we didn’t do that, `initialValue` would be `undefined`. So when we look at the callback function, we can see a problem:

```tsx
(accumulator, currentValue, _indexOfCurrent, _array) => {
  // accumulator = undefined at this point!
  return accumulator + currentValue; // undefined + 23 = NaN
};

// sumAges = NaN now!
```

### Real-World

Let's say we're working with an array of objects that looks like this type definition:

```tsx
type PriceObject {
    subTotal: number,
    tax: number,
    discount?: number
}
```

You'll notice that `discount` is an _optional_ parameter in this object, so it could possibly be undefined. Reduce will make this work perfectly.
Let's work with an array of these `PriceObject`s to simulate a shopping cart of sorts, and each item could possibly have a `discount` parameter so we can show the user how much they're saving.

Here's what we want at the end of the day:

```tsx
type ShoppingCart = PriceObject[];

const shoppingCart: ShoppingCart = [
  {
    subTotal: 15.1,
    tax: 0.91,
  },
  {
    subTotal: 12.15,
    tax: 0.73,
    discount: 3,
  },
];

// Right here is where we want to implement reduce
// to combine (or *reduce*) the array into a single thing
const shoppingCartCombined = {
  subTotal: 27.25,
  tax: 1.64,
  discount: 3,
};
```

Now that we know what we want (a combined shopping cart object combining the parameters), we can solve it with reduce!

```tsx
const initialPriceObject: PriceObject = {
  subTotal: 0,
  tax: 0,
  discount: 0,
};

const shoppingCartCombined = shoppingCart.reduce(
  (acc, curr): PriceObject => ({
    subTotal: acc.subTotal + curr.subTotal,
    tax: acc.tax + curr.tax,
    discount:
      curr.discount === undefined ? acc.discount : acc.discount + curr.discount,
  }),
  initialPriceObject
);
```

Let's look at this. We intialize our `reduce` with an `initialPriceObject` which _ensures_ that we have all of our properties defined with an _initial value_ of `0`.
This is important later because it makes sure `acc` is an object with all our properties defined with a real value and not `undefined`.

In our `reduce` callback, we take the accumulated value and current value, and return an object that will always return an object with all properties of `PriceObject` defined with at least a `0`. If we wanted to display this on a UI, we can just check if `shoppingCartCombined.discount !== 0` and that will always work because it will never be anything other than a number. We have this guaruntee because `discount: curr.discount === undefined ? acc.discount : acc.discount + curr.discount` accounts for an object where `discount` is not a defined property and just returns the accumulated value if it isn't, and a new value if it is.

### Conclusion

`map` and `reduce` are super powerful. As a developer, I'm happy that it operates in a functional style and is super predictable and testable because of that. They are incredibly useful tools that should be a part of every JavaScript developers toolbelt.
