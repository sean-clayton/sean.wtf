## Update 2022-01-07

I have since changed the license _once again_ to the [Free Public License](/fpl) license. As always, it is a completely free license, and is public domain equivalent :)

## Update 2021-04-17

I have since changed the license _once again_ to my own license, the [WTFPL-69.420](/WTFPL-69.420) license. It is as free as CC0, so everything here still applies :)

I am not a fan (_at all_) of copyright.
Not only copyright, but the idea of intellectual "property" alltogether.
The idea of using a violent force such as the state to maintain a monopoly on something that cannot be stolen just seems crazy to me.

To be consistent with my ideas, I have converted the license of the software this site is made with from MIT to Unlicense.
The articles on this site have been changed licenses from CC-BY-4.0 to CC0-1.0.

I will not threaten the use of the police to prevent you from copying things from this site.
I reject completely the idea of threatening you with the violence of the police if you simply _copy_ something.
Not steal, not destroyâ€”_copy_.

Absolutely bonkers.
