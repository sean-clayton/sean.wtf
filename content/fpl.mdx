### Goal

A professional-environment-friendly license that is [Public Domain Equivalent] (Like [CC0], [Unlicense], [WTFPL], and [0BSD]), but with the distinction of not being specific to software.

### Recipe

1. Copy 0BSD
2. Replace "software" with "work"
3. ?????
4. ~~Profit~~ Freedom

### FAQ

#### Why not the WTFPL?

Personally, I like the WTFPL.
Unfortunately, though, it's not available for use in most workplaces.

I am as [anti-copyright as they come](/anti-copyright/)&mdash;I would love for everyone to use the WTFPL or [its variants](/WTFPL-69.420) that maintain its vulgarity.
Though, if what prevents someone from releasing _truly free_ software out into the wild is the name of the license, then my ego shouldn't step in the way of that.

#### Why not CC0?

Too much language.
The Free Public License is straight to the point.
The Free Public License also makes _zero_ mention of Public Domain, which is by-design.

#### Why not the Unlicense?

Same as CC0, it makes mention of the Public Domain.
Additionally, the Unlicense is meant for software only.
The Free Public License is not restricted to only software.
_All works can use the Free Public License._

#### Why not 0BSD?

Like the Unlicense, 0BSD is meant for software only.
